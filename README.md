# dronev2
An ESP32 drone library designed to simplify the coding and customization process of drone programming. Its extensibility and modular design make it worth trying. This library was inspired by the modular nature of the IoTDroneFirmware project but has been rewritten for a cleaner syntax and easier interfacing.
