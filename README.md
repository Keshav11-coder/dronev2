# ***[Coming soon]***

# Things to note:
1. Library files were compiled and tested on the ESP32 DEVKIT V1 board, ***using the esp32 board version 3.1.0***
2. All files were compiled using ***Arduino IDE 1.8.19 running C++17***
3. Sketch storage space for all files (acknowledging the esp32 board) ***range from ~24% to ~26% sketch storage***, and ***global variables using up ~6% to ~7%***.
4. ***Free heap ranges from ~20000 to ~44000 for all examples*** (more information will be provided soon*)

* We're still in the writing process of this README, changes will be made soon, including a full and descriptive API guide.
